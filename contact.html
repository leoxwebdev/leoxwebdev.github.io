						<div class="FloatRightPad1">
							<img class="IpatungaDblock" src="pbayImages/guest2.jpg" alt="Plantation Bay Resort and Spa - GUEST COMMENTS" />
						</div>
						<p class="iJustify">When was the last time you filled out a guest comment form at a hotel? When was the last time you felt moved to leave a complimentary note about your stay?</p>
						<p class="iJustify"> We get almost 100,000 visitors a year, and they are virtually unanimous in calling Plantation Bay one of the best hotels they have ever stayed in. Few hotels, at any price, enjoy this kind of guest satisfaction. And our guest roster includes families, couples, business-persons, retirees, singles, divers - ALL kinds of travelers co-exist happily at Plantation Bay.</p>
						<p class="iJustify">And remember, tipping is prohibited throughout the resort. We give <strong><em>all</em></strong> our guests the highest standard of service, without their ever having to worry about when, whom, or how much to tip.</p>
						<p class="iJustify"><strong><i>Social Media Sites and TripAdvisor.</i></strong>In the age of the Internet, anyone can post a review about a hotel, whether he has actually been there or not. Because it has long been widely known that Plantation Bay's Guest Satisfaction and Word-of-Mouth are the best in the country, certain other hotels, desperate for business, have hired PR firms to sponsor positive reviews about themselves, and negative reviews about us.</p>
						<p class="iJustify">Most of these sponsored reviews are on user-generated sites, and the most well-known of these is TripAdvisor, which accepts reviews from anyone with an e-mail. It makes no effort to verify if the reviews are by real paying guests, or if they are honest and fair. In addition, TripAdvisor has spawned a new class of hotel guest, bent on bullying hotels with the spoken or unspoken threat of posting an ugly review. Some of them are motivated by the hope of getting a freebie or an upgrade, others just want to feel important, and others have anger management issues. A small number of cranks and crazies on this site even post again and again, turning a single weekend stay into a dozen negative reviews. (If you don't understand why anyone would do this, it's all right; that shows you probably aren't a crank.)</p>
						<p class="iJustify">Though Plantation Bay receives many excellent comments on TripAdvisor, and indeed was given its Award of Excellence 2013, you should understand that TripAdvisor reviews can be misleading, and that many of the negative reviews on TripAdvisor are bogus (planted by competitors) or written by people with extreme points of view that the typical traveler would not agree with. The following links discuss some of the pitfalls of naively trusting social media, believing the words of people you never met and who may not even exist, to make a decision involving thousands of dollars.</p>

						<p class="iJustify">On Tripadvisor, many hotels in Mactan have one glowing review after another, often peppered with "facts"

The food in Kilimanjaro, Fiji, Savannah, and Palermo were so good. The scenery and the design were truly magnificent and it’s a kid-friendly place. Staying in the pool and in the lagoon de-stresses one’s mind and body.

We enjoyed the pools, the firing range, the kids amenities, game room, the free bicycle ride. I also love the welcome/ complimentary basket. The employees are very courteous and always smiling! Very Good.

										This (the Philippines versus Syria tie) was 
			                        an exceptionally well organized Tie by PHILTA (Philippine 
			                        Tennis Association). Thank you, Randy and your team for 
			                        contributing to what was an oustandingly presented Tie, 
			                        Court and Formal Functions. Accolades must also be of 
			                        the highest to Plantation Resort and Spa. They were unbelievably 
			                        obliging, helpful, friendly and their staff were simply 
			                        amazing in the attention to all the little detail that 
			                        was asked of them. The hospitality and friendship that 
			                        they and in fact everyone extended to the Syrian team 
			                        caused them to come to me with players shaking my hand 
			                        to say that this is the best Davis Cup Tie that they have 
			                        ever been involved in. So Randy, you, your team and Plantation 
			                        Bay Resort and Spa Management deserve every credit for 
			                        this.

									<li><p class="L">Mogambo Springs is by far the best spa we have experienced in Asia.  We were most intrigued by the Filipino Hilot massage, but seeing as we managed an appointment for that only a day later, we test drove the foot reflexology instead. I’m not quite sure what the therapist did, but it was like she unlocked something in my toes. Something that I didn’t know had been locked all this while. The next day the Hilot massage was equally satisfying, as we both dozed off to the gentle music and strokes of pressure. Realizing that this spa was indeed value for money, we returned every day, getting massages and even a cucumber body wrap the day after I got sunburned snorkeling in the reef.

Check-in and check-out were done in a short time.  We easily got our room even if we arrived at 1:30 PM and check-in was at 3 PM - and this was at a time when there were many guests.  NO long hours in waiting and I appreciated it a lot!  The nicest thing was that there was NO-TIPPING POLICY, which gave us the assurance that all guests are treated equally.

The place itself is heaven for vacationers, your food in all 4 restaurants is superb, your staff's service is very distinct, the activities we can do are numerous that not a day goes by we are not entertained. Lastly, our overall stay was worth every penny— the memories, the laughter and the sunburn were all a FUNtastic experience. We will surely return next year, and recommend you to our family and friends. Keep up the good work!

Due to a dispute of uncertain nature, the Spaniards incurred the ire of local chieftain Lapu-lapu, who killed Magellan in The Battle of Mactan &#8211; arguably the first case of an Asian fighting European invaders. Thus, although the Magellan Expedition is credited with the first circumnavigation of the globe, Magellan the man died and remained in Mactan.</p>

						<p class="iJustify"><i>(It is said in some chronicles that Magellan&#8217;s expedition included a Cebuano-speaking crewman, who must have earlier wandered across Asia, the Near East, and the Mediterranean before joining the expedition in Spain. When the expedition reached Cebu, this crewman &#8211; a Cebuano &#8211; became the first person to actually complete a tour of the world.)</i></p>
						<p class="iJustify">During the early part of the Spanish era, Cebu was the effective capital of the country, which in turn was a province of Mexico. <i>(The capital was later moved to Manila, which was more easily defensible against sea attack.)</i> It continued to prosper as a trading port. And to this day, Cebu is the most ethnically diverse area in the country, with large Chinese, Spanish, and Malayan populations <i>(not to mention more recent German and Americanarrivals)</i>.</p>
						<p class="iJustify">Cebu today is regarded as the most dynamic metro area in the country, with growth rates generally twice as high as the national average. It is home to a surprising range of industries, including semiconductors, shipping, education, watch making, food-processing, high-end furniture, and of course tourism. <i>(A bit of trivia: Almost all the Timex watches sold anywhere in the world are made in Cebu.)</i></p>

						<h3 class="leoxTitle1">TRULY BLESSED BY NATURE</h3>
						<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>
						<p class="iJustify"><i>How many of these are serious dangers at Plantation Bay? Tsunamis, Typhoons, Earthquakes, Volcanoes, Sharks, 
							Crocodiles, Venomous Snakes, Malaria, Typhoid.</i></p>
						<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
						<p class="iJustify"><i>None of the above. Plantation Bay&#8217;s location on Mactan Island is truly blessed, and there is probably no 
							other resort area anywhere else in the world that is so well-insulated against assorted natural perils.</i></p>
						<div class="FloatRightPad1">
							<img class="IpatungaDblock" src="pbayImages/philmap2.jpg" alt="Plantation Bay Resort and Spa - Truly Blessed by Nature" />
						</div>
						<p class="iJustify">Cebu is located in the heart of the Philippines, totally surrounded by much larger islands. This means that most 
							typhoons never reach Cebu, and the rare storms that do are already much-weakened. The danger from tsunamis is 
							effectively zero; there is no known seismic fault in this area, and any long-range tsunami would be blocked by 
							other islands.</p>
						<p class="iJustify">The Pacific monsoon drops most of its moisture on other islands prior to reaching Cebu. Thus, there is no pronounced 
							rainy season and the weather here is clement year-round. Although it can rain at any time of year, most rains 
							are brief and quickly followed by brilliant sunshine. <i>(Before being tempted by the &#8220;low season&#8221; 
							rates offered elsewhere, better ask why there&#8217;s a low season. Cebu doesn&#8217;t have one.)</i></p>
						<p class="iJustify">The entire island of Cebu is an ancient coral outcropping <i>(not of volcanic origin like Hawaii, or near a 
							continental shelf like Bali or Phuket)</i>. There are no volcanoes, and the area does not experience any 
							appreciable earthquake activity.</p>
						<p class="iJustify">Plantation Bay faces Hilutungan Channel, which is 300 meters deep and has a steady current. This not only makes 
							the waters here exceptionally clean <i>(and the scuba-diving awesome)</i>, but also free of dangerous sharks 
							and barracuda, which like to scavenge in still, shallow waters.</p>
						<p class="iJustify">Mactan being a classic desert island, there are no swamps or wetlands here which could harbor crocodiles or 
							venomous snakes. The island is virtually flat and not very large, so floods and mudslides are geologically 
							improbable.</p>
						<p class="iJustify">Although Plantation Bay feels like a world of its own, it is after all one hour from a major metropolitan area. 
							So, unlike most resorts in Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, India, and Sri Lanka, Cebu has no significant incidence 
							of tropical diseases such as malaria or typhoid. For a personal medical emergency, there is a community hospital 
							10 minutes away from Plantation Bay, and several fully-equipped general hospitals one hour away in Cebu City. 
							In case of a burst appendix or abcessed tooth, you wouldn&#8217;t have to wait for a helicopter airlift.</p>

						</div>
						<p class="iJustify"><em>Plantation Bay was built and is operated with appropriate regard for environmental concerns.</em></p>
						<p class="iJustify">Our lovely artificial lagoon was built over a site consisting of barren rock, so no ecosystem was destroyed 
							for the resort. To create fabulous white-sand beaches bordering the lagoon, mountain stone was quarried and 
							crushed into fine grains. <i>(A bonus is that, unlike real beach sand, ours is always cool to the touch, 
							even under direct sun.) </i>Thus, no natural beaches or sandbars were despoiled. The fine woods used in 
							some furniture were recycled from old houses or church timbers. The wood ceilings seen in the lobby and 
							many bedrooms and meeting rooms are actually made of ordinary plywood, painstakingly hand-stained to simulate 
							the look of mahogany panels.</p>
						<p class="iJustify">Extensive use was made of coconut timber, a widely-available renewable resource. Other coconut parts of little 
							commercial value were used in decorations and finishes around the resort. The use of plastics was avoided 
							wherever possible, a feature which also lessens fire and smoke hazards.

							<img class="IpatungaDblock" src="pbayImages/cleaner2006.jpg" alt="Plantation Bay Resort and Spa - A resort with a social conscience" />
						</div>	
						<p class="iJustify">Plantation Bay provides free school bus service in the community, making it possible for hundreds of local children 
							<i>(who could not afford public transportation)</i> to obtain a basic education. On a continuing basis, 
							we support a number of local residents for vocational training. In 2004 Plantation Bay paid for the reforestation 
							of about 120 hectares in Cebu&#8217;s highlands, and regularly conducts beach clean-ups to increase environmental 
							awareness. Plantation Bay provided most of the funding to build and operate a day-care center for indigent 
							families in South Cebu City, and an orphanage for street children in Manila. Yearly, since 2008, the resort 
							provides free medical services to a total of over 1,000 local residents.</p>
						<p class="iJustify">The employees of Plantation Bay enjoy good salaries and benefits. Equally important, all staff members are 
							treated with dignity and respect as part of the Plantation Bay Family. Training and career-advancement 
							opportunities are provided to all staff members. A flattened and informal hierarchy system improves work 
							performance and efficiency while providing a personal sense of satisfaction to every staff member. 
							For these reasons, Plantation Bay is considered one of the best workplaces in the country. Guests quickly 
							notice and appreciate our staff&#8217;s excellent morale and eagerness to please.

							<img class="IpatungaDblock" src="pbayImages/marine.jpg" alt="Plantation Bay Resort and Spa - Sanitation" />
						</div>			
						
						<h3 class="txtDarkGreen shadow1px">SANITATION</h3>
						<p class="iJustify">The resort employs septic tanks for residential sewage, spread out over a large area to avoid a 
							concentration of effluent. The laundry is equipped with a biomechanical waste treatment plant. 
							No wastes are dumped into the sea. The resort&#8217;s garbage is trucked to landfills in Mactan; 
							some garbage is recycled as fish-feed. Bottles and cans are separated and sold to recyclers.</p>
						
						<h3 class="txtDarkGreen shadow1px">MARINE LIFE</h3>
						<p class="iJustify">Plantation Bay grows some of its own fish <i>(for restaurant use)</i> in fishponds within the hotel. 
							In partnership with universities and public agencies, Plantation Bay cooperates in all efforts to protect 
							marine life and promote the stability of coral reefs. Since the resort opened in 1996, there has been a 
							dramatic re-growth of the coral reefs in our part of Mactan Island.</p>

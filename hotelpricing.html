					All prices in the Philippines are subject to 12% Value Added Tax. At the same
					time, in accordance with industry norms in the country, Plantation Bay also adds
					a 10% service charge, which is distributed monthly to all the regular employees
					of the hotel, in equal shares. Where a figure is shown with + after the numbers,
					this means that 10% service charge will be added. Thus, P 100 + means that
					your final tab for that item will be P 110. P 100 ++ means that your final tab
					will be around P 123.2 for that item, after both VAT and the service charge
					are added. Finally, in some cases, we quote prices "Nett", which means that
					whatever VAT and service charge are applicable are already included in that
					figure; hence, P 100 Nett means that your bill will be P 100. We apologize for
					any confusion this might cause, but assure you that all hotels in the country do
					(or should do) the same thing, with the difference that we actually pay our VAT
					taxes, and actually pay out the service charge to our employees, whereas some
					might not.
